## Building the program
If you have Python 3, `pygame-ce` and `pyYAML` installed, then there should be no real need to do any work.
## Contributing
To add new forms of spatula and more player skins, the `data.yaml` file can be edited. Details of how that data is stored can be found in the comments in the file. bkah blah
